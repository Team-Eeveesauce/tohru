# Tohru
Tohru is a little Discord bot that doesn't do anything remotely useful.  
Mostly just designed to be used in the DTAG server, it can do certain things that are largely unrelated.

## Features
  * PING the bot to make sure it's online.
  * CONNECT to check if Kanna is awake.
  * GAMING will ask Kanna to open the Epic Games Launcher.
  * UPLOAD images to then be crustified and stored in the archive for later.

## Kanna
Kanna is Tohru's Windows-based friend who does stuff that Tohru can't do, since Tohru is designed to run on Linux and not Windows.
So, unless you run Tohru on a Linux system and also have a Windows system that you wanna use the same features as Kanna supports... it might not be entirely useful.

## Setup
So, there's like, a lot of stuff you need to install for this.
  * Python 3

Shocking, I know. There's also the very short list of packages you need, which you can install with `pip3 install py-cord mysql-connector-python dotenv Pillow`

I *THINK* that's all you need, but I probably missed something.

## FAQ
**Q.** Why is it named this way?  
**A.** Well, Tohru is a dragon maid, and not only is "dragon" the name of the css for the redesign of the DTAG website, but a maid is also supposed to do stuff for you when you ask. And of course, Kanna is Tohru's smaller also-dragon friend.

**Q.** Nerd.  
**A.** Hey, nobody said you had to be here.
