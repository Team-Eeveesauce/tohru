# Contributing
Okay so I'm not very good at working in a Team because I like to do things my own way, but if you have some really good ideas that are actually useful and I like your coding style, I might take some help.

Generally though? New features are kind of, well, I don't know how to put this...

Basically, this is kind of MY bot. I appreciate if you want to add new things, and you can! Make a fork! Do whatever!
But I might not be so happy if someone else does something in this repo before I have the chance to.

Thanks for your support anyway! :)
